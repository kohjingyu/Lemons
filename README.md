Android app for keeping track of life.

This application allows the user to keep track of their activities and motivate themselves to make improvements to their daily life.

We use gamification elements such as achievements, upgrades to avatar and levels to motivate the user.

This project is part of our SUTD ISTD 50.001 Introduction to Information System Course.
